Users are offered a drop-down list of data sources.  These might be  neighborhood medium incomes, gun ownership, IT accessibility, grocery stores,pollution

Users will be provided with an option to see the data sets on the map. I have implemented the NY state Farmer Market data and next step is to implement GeoJson data to add polygons on the map.
